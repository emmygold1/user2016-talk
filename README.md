# user2016-talk
Peter's talk at UseR! 2016, Wednesday 1:36pm, Stanford: GNU make for reproducible data analysis using R and other statistical software

## Making the slides:

Either
1) load into RStudio and press buttons, or
2) download common.mk from <https://github.com/petebaker/r-makefile-definitions> and **make** it

NB: Just in case my University doesn't like me distributing the logo, I've modified it slightly
