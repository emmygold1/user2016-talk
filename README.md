# user2016-talk
Peter's talk at UseR! 2016, Wednesday 1:36pm, Stanford: GNU make for reproducible data analysis using R and other statistical software

## Making the slides:

Either

1. load into RStudio and press the buttons, or
2. download common.mk from <https://github.com/petebaker/r-makefile-definitions> and **make** it

You can even try 

* make pbaker\_user2016-3\_slidy.html
* make pbaker\_user2016-3\_beamer.pdf

NB: Just in case my University doesn't like me distributing the logo, I've modified it slightly to the point where it doesn't work ;-)
